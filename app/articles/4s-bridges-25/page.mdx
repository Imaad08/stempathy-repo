STEMpathy returned to the 4S Ranch Library—this time to explore the physics of bridges! Through a hands-on workshop using popsicle sticks and hot glue, we taught students how real bridges work by introducing key engineering concepts like compression and tension. To make it even more exciting, the kids tested the strength of their bridges by stacking books on them!

## What did we do?

We led a fun and engaging session where students designed and built their own bridges out of popsicle sticks. Along the way, they learned about two important forces that affect bridges—**compression** (pushing forces) and **tension** (pulling forces)—and how engineers balance these forces in real-world structures like the **Golden Gate Bridge**.

Once the bridges were built, each student had the chance to test their structure by adding books on top until it collapsed. This real-time testing helped them understand what makes a bridge strong and how different designs hold up under pressure.

## Impacts

This workshop gave students an exciting, hands-on way to explore engineering and physics. Here’s how it made an impact:

1. **Applied Learning:** Building and testing bridges helped students directly apply scientific concepts in a memorable way.

2. **Understanding Engineering Forces:** By feeling and observing the effects of tension and compression, kids developed a deeper understanding of what keeps bridges standing.

3. **Testing and Iteration:** Watching their bridges hold—or collapse—taught students the value of trial and error in engineering design.

4. **Critical Thinking:** The kids analyzed which designs worked best and why, encouraging them to think like real engineers.

5. **Teamwork and Communication:** Many worked in small groups, sharing ideas and learning how to collaborate on a single structure.

6. **STEM Confidence:** Successfully building a bridge that could support multiple books gave students a sense of pride and confidence in their abilities.

## Summary

* Taught compression, tension, and bridge structure basics
* Built popsicle stick bridges with hot glue
* Tested bridge strength using stacks of books
* Promoted engineering design, teamwork, and problem-solving

This workshop turned a simple set of materials into a powerful lesson in engineering. We can’t wait to see what these young engineers build next!
