## What We Did

Great news! STEMpathy recently hit a milestone by raising $400 to bring a brand new robotics kit to VIDYA School in India. Imagine the joy and excitement on the faces of the students as they received this incredible opportunity to dive into the world of robotics.



But here's the twist - we didn't stop there! The STEMpathy team decided to take things up a notch. We packed our bags, hopped on a plane, and hand-delivered the robotics kit to VIDYA School. Seeing the enthusiasm of the students firsthand was an experience like no other.



While we were there, we couldn't resist spreading the STEM love even further. We ended up visiting another school, Holy Cross, in person. The passion for learning and exploring new horizons was contagious, and we couldn't help but share our knowledge and excitement about robotics with the students at Holy Cross.



Now, you might be wondering about VIDYA School. Don't worry; we've got a plan for them too! Although we couldn't stay and teach them in person, we're not leaving them in the lurch. Our next move is to send them a curriculum so they can start learning and experimenting with the robotics kit we provided. Our goal? To prepare them for the World Robot Olympiad (WRO)!



Imagine VIDYA School, with their newfound knowledge and skills, competing on a global stage like WRO. It's not just about winning; it's about fostering a love for STEM, encouraging creativity, and opening doors to endless possibilities.



So here's to STEMpathy and everyone who contributed to making this journey possible! Your support is creating ripples of change, reaching schools and students who might not have had access to such opportunities before.



Let's continue to spread STEMpathy far and wide, making a difference, one robotics kit at a time. Together, we're building a brighter future filled with innovation, curiosity, and endless possibilities. Keep the STEM love alive!
