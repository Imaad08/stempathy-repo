STEMpathy had the amazing opportunity to run an electricity workshop at the **Saksharta Foundation** in India, where students explored the basics of **circuits and electrical energy**—with a twist! Using apples, copper, zinc, and wires, they discovered how fruit can generate electricity and power small devices.

## What did we do?

We began by introducing students to the **fundamentals of electricity**—covering circuits, conductors, insulators, and how electric current flows. Then came the fun part: building their own **fruit batteries** using apples, copper wires, and zinc nails.

Students connected the materials and watched as their apple-powered circuits generated enough electricity to light up small LEDs. The hands-on nature of the activity helped reinforce key concepts and showed how even everyday objects can demonstrate scientific principles.

## Impacts

This workshop made the abstract idea of electricity more concrete and engaging. Here’s what students took away:

1. **Tangible Learning:** Instead of just hearing about electricity, students saw it in action—powered by something as simple as an apple.

2. **Understanding Circuits:** They learned how electrical energy flows through a circuit and how different materials affect conductivity.

3. **Creative Exploration:** Students experimented with different fruit types and wiring setups to see what worked best.

4. **Resourceful Science:** The workshop showed that you don’t need fancy equipment to explore science—just curiosity and creativity.

5. **Problem-Solving and Discovery:** As they troubleshooted non-working circuits and tweaked connections, students developed critical thinking and resilience.

6. **Excitement for STEM:** The surprise and joy of lighting up a bulb with fruit sparked genuine excitement and interest in science.

## Summary

* Taught basic electricity concepts using apples, copper, and zinc
* Built fruit-powered circuits to light LEDs
* Reinforced circuit-building, conductivity, and energy flow
* Encouraged hands-on exploration and STEM curiosity

The Saksharta Foundation students impressed us with their enthusiasm and eagerness to learn. This workshop was a great reminder that science is everywhere—and that learning can be both simple and powerful.
