STEMpathy was thrilled to host an engaging robotics workshop at **Pragnya Bodhini High School** in India, where students explored the world of **robotics and coding** using **LEGO SPIKE Prime kits**. This hands-on session introduced core STEM concepts while encouraging creativity, collaboration, and critical thinking.

## What did we do?

In this interactive workshop, students got the chance to build and program their own robots using LEGO SPIKE Prime. We started with an introduction to robotics and the basics of block-based programming. As students grew more confident, we introduced **Python** to give them a deeper look into text-based coding.

The excitement grew as students saw their robots come to life—moving, turning, and reacting to obstacles based on the programs they wrote. Whether it was their first time coding or they had prior experience, every student had something new to learn and explore.

## Impacts

This workshop gave students a powerful introduction to robotics and programming. Here’s how it made an impact:

1. **Hands-On Learning:** Building and programming their own robots allowed students to directly apply abstract concepts in a tangible, memorable way.

2. **Introduction to Coding:** For many, this was their first exposure to block coding or Python. It sparked curiosity and made programming feel accessible.

3. **Problem-Solving in Action:** Students encountered challenges in their builds and code—but learned to debug, adjust, and think critically to solve them.

4. **Creativity and Design:** Each robot was a little different, as students brought their own ideas and solutions into the builds.

5. **Teamwork and Communication:** Working in pairs or groups helped students build collaboration skills and share knowledge.

6. **STEM Confidence:** Seeing their programs successfully control a robot boosted students' confidence and interest in future STEM opportunities.

## Summary

* Introduced LEGO SPIKE Prime robotics at Pragnya Bodhini High School
* Taught block coding and Python programming
* Encouraged hands-on building, design, and testing
* Fostered problem-solving, teamwork, and STEM confidence

We were inspired by the energy and enthusiasm of the students at Pragnya Bodhini. It was incredible to see their ideas come to life through robotics—and we can’t wait to see where their STEM journey takes them next!
