STEMpathy had another wonderful opportunity to teach kids at Design39, this time focusing on the water cycle. Through hands-on activities, we introduced the concepts of condensation and vaporization, making the learning experience engaging and memorable.

## What did we do?

We led an interactive learning lab that demonstrated the water cycle in action. Here's how:

- **Boiling Water and Ice Experiment:** We placed boiling water in a cup inside a Tupperware container, covered it with plastic wrap, and put ice in the center of the wrap. As the water vapor rose, it condensed on the plastic and eventually fell as water droplets, demonstrating how water vapor turns into liquid through condensation.
  
- **Explaining Key Processes:** We discussed vaporization (the process of water turning into vapor) and condensation (vapor cooling down and turning back into water), helping the kids understand the water cycle’s key stages in a simple way.

- **Interactive Learning:** The kids were able to observe the water cycle happening in front of them, which made the scientific concepts much more tangible and easy to understand.

## Impacts

Teaching the water cycle through a hands-on experiment had several key benefits:

1. **Practical Application:** The boiling water and ice experiment allowed the kids to visualize the water cycle in action, making it easier for them to grasp the concepts.

2. **Understanding of Natural Processes:** By seeing vaporization and condensation firsthand, the kids deepened their understanding of how the water cycle works in nature.

3. **Curiosity and Exploration:** The experiment sparked curiosity, leading the kids to ask questions about where water comes from and how it travels through the environment.

4. **Confidence in Science:** Engaging with the experiment helped build the kids’ confidence in their ability to understand and explain scientific processes.

## Summary

- Introduced the water cycle, focusing on vaporization and condensation
- Conducted a hands-on experiment using boiling water, plastic wrap, and ice
- Made the water cycle easier to understand through real-time observation
- Inspired curiosity about how water moves through the environment

The kids had a blast seeing the water cycle in action and left with a deeper understanding of this essential natural process!
