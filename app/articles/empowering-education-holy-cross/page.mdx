## What We Did
We are thrilled to share the story of STEMpathy's recent efforts to give back to the community and inspire the next generation of STEM enthusiasts. This year, our team went above and beyond to raise funds for an exciting cause: donating robotics kits to schools in India. With the support of our local community, we managed to collectively raise $800, which was then used to purchase a selection of robotics kits.



Our goal was not just to contribute financially, but also to share the joy of discovery and learning with children who might not otherwise have access to such opportunities. We decided to send the kits to Holy Cross which is a school in India.



But our impact didn't stop at sending the kits. STEMpathy took a personal approach by traveling to India to hand deliver the kits and teach the students themselves. We spent time with 25 eager students, introducing them to the world of robotics and encouraging them to explore the endless possibilities that STEM offers.



The students' excitement was through the roof, and their expressions of gratitude touched our hearts deeply. They were genuinely thrilled to learn about robotics and were eager to apply their newfound knowledge. Their enthusiasm was heart warming, and it was a wonderful experience to see the impact of our donation firsthand.



At STEMpathy, we believe in the transformative power of education, especially when it's combined with real-world application. By sharing our passion for STEM with these students, we hope to inspire them to pursue their dreams and become leaders in their communities.



We are incredibly proud of the work we did this year and look forward to continuing our efforts to make a difference. Our donation to Holy Cross is just one small step towards bridging the gap between education and opportunity. We encourage everyone to consider getting involved in similar initiatives, as together, we can shape the future of STEM education and create a better world.
