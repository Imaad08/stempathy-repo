STEMpathy brought hands-on architecture and engineering fun to the **Poway Library**, where students used **marshmallows and thick toothpicks** to explore the science of structural design. From towering skyscrapers to a surprise bridge at the end, students learned what it takes to build strong and stable structures.

## What did we do?

The workshop started with a brief introduction to **structural engineering**—focusing on how shapes like **triangles**, **squares**, and **cross-bracing** can make buildings more stable. Students then put their knowledge to work by building the tallest tower they could using only marshmallows and toothpicks.

As their confidence and creativity grew, some groups began experimenting with horizontal spans—and eventually, we challenged them to **build a bridge** using the same materials. They had to think critically about weight distribution, balance, and base support as they shifted from vertical to horizontal design.

## Impacts

This activity gave students an approachable way to explore real-world engineering principles. Here's how it helped them grow:

1. **Foundations in Architecture:** Students gained a basic understanding of structural strength, stability, and geometry in building design.

2. **Trial-and-Error Thinking:** Many structures collapsed at first, but students learned from each attempt and built better versions—just like real engineers.

3. **Shape Awareness:** The strength of triangles vs. the instability of squares became clear through hands-on experimentation.

4. **Teamwork and Strategy:** Working together, students discussed and revised their plans, learning the importance of collaboration and shared problem-solving.

5. **Creativity and Innovation:** Some students went beyond the challenge and began designing unique bridge-tower hybrids and complex frameworks.

6. **Increased STEM Confidence:** Every successfully standing tower or bridge gave students a confidence boost and excitement to take on more engineering challenges.

## Summary

* Taught basic architectural principles and engineering design
* Students built tall towers and bridges using marshmallows and toothpicks
* Explored strength through shape, base design, and balance
* Encouraged creativity, teamwork, and iterative thinking

The Poway Library workshop was a perfect blend of fun and learning, leaving students inspired by what they could build—and eager for their next STEM adventure!
