The STEMpathy summer camp was a huge success this year! Over 100 kids attended the camp over two weeks and had a blast discovering more about STEM. The camp was held at the 4S Ranch Library and was taught by Del Norte High School club members.

## What did the kids learn?

The kids learned about a variety of STEM topics, including robotics, coding, and engineering. They had the opportunity to build their own robots, write code, and design and build their own engineering projects.
What did the kids say about the camp?
"I loved learning how to build a robot [...] When is your next camp? I can't wait to come again."


## What did the parents say about the camp?


"Today's clinic was fantastic!"


Overall, we are ecstatic that the STEMpathy summer camp was able to connect with so many kids! We're so grateful to the 4S Ranch Library for providing us with a space to hold the camp. The kids had a fun-filled learning experience, discovering more about the diverse world of STEM and finding what their passions along the way! We're already looking forward to next year's camp!
