STEMpathy had an incredible experience teaching at the Sakshita NGO Foundation in India, where we worked with a variety of age groups over two days. We introduced students to LEGO Spike Prime building, block coding, and the engineering principles behind bridges.

## Day 1: LEGO Spike Prime and Block Coding

On the first day, we dove into hands-on activities with LEGO Spike Prime kits. The students explored building and programming using block coding, sparking their creativity and problem-solving skills. The goal was to create functional robots, which the kids enthusiastically brought to life with their own designs and coding logic.

### What did we do?

1. **LEGO Spike Prime Building:** We started by guiding the students through assembling basic robot structures. This helped them develop an understanding of mechanical design and how different components work together.
   
2. **Block Coding:** Once the robots were assembled, we introduced block coding to program movements and interactions. The students experimented with loops, conditionals, and sensors to make their robots perform tasks.

### Highlights
- The excitement in the room as the robots came to life was infectious.
- Students enjoyed debugging their code, showing persistence and critical thinking.
- Teams collaborated to improve their designs and coding.

## Day 2: Bridges and Engineering Principles

The second day was dedicated to bridge building. We used simple materials like popsicle sticks and hot glue to teach the physics behind bridges, focusing on concepts like tension and compression. We also highlighted real-world examples such as the iconic Howrah Bridge in India.

### What did we do?

1. **Understanding Bridge Physics:** We explained the basic forces at work in bridges and how they contribute to structural stability.
   
2. **Building Bridges:** Students worked in teams to design and build their own popsicle stick bridges. They tested their creations to see how much weight they could hold, refining their designs as they learned more about engineering principles.

### Highlights
- The kids’ creativity shone as they designed unique bridges.
- Watching the students test their bridges was both thrilling and educational.
- Collaboration and teamwork were evident as groups overcame challenges together.

## Impacts

This workshop made a significant impact on the students:

1. **Hands-On Learning:** Engaging with real-world tools and challenges brought STEM concepts to life.
2. **Confidence Boost:** Completing projects and seeing their creations succeed boosted the students' confidence in STEM.
3. **Teamwork:** Working in groups enhanced their communication and collaboration skills.
4. **Inspiration:** The activities sparked interest in robotics, coding, and civil engineering, inspiring many to pursue further learning.

## Summary

- Introduced LEGO Spike Prime building and block coding on Day 1.
- Taught bridge physics and facilitated hands-on bridge construction on Day 2.
- Fostered problem-solving, collaboration, and an interest in STEM fields.

We’re grateful to the Sakshita NGO Foundation for giving us the opportunity to inspire young minds. Seeing the students' enthusiasm and creativity was truly rewarding. We can’t wait to return and continue this incredible journey of spreading STEM education!
