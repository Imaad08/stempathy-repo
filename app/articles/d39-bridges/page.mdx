STEMpathy had the wonderful opportunity to teach the physics of bridges to a group of kids at Design39. Through hands-on activities with popsicle sticks and hot glue, we introduced concepts like compression, tension, and bridge design. A special focus was given to the Golden Gate Bridge in San Francisco, helping the kids connect engineering principles to real-world structures.

## What did we do?

We led an interactive workshop where the kids constructed their own popsicle stick bridges. Along the way, we explained the forces at work in bridgesâ€”how tension and compression make these structures strong. The kids learned to identify the key parts of a bridge and apply these concepts to their designs.

They were particularly excited to build and test their bridges to see how much weight they could support. We encouraged experimentation, letting them tweak their designs based on their results, and emphasized collaboration to solve design challenges.

## Impacts

Teaching about bridge physics through hands-on construction can have lasting benefits. Here's how this workshop impacted the kids:

1. **Practical Application:** Building bridges from popsicle sticks and hot glue allowed the kids to see engineering principles in action, making the learning experience engaging and tangible.

2. **Understanding Forces:** The kids learned how compression and tension work together to create stable bridges. This understanding was deepened by connecting their designs to real-life structures like the Golden Gate Bridge.

3. **Problem-Solving:** Each group faced challenges as they built and tested their bridges. Solving these challenges helped build resilience and improved their critical thinking skills.

4. **Collaboration and Teamwork:** Working in pairs or groups encouraged the kids to collaborate, exchange ideas, and refine their designs based on feedback and results.

5. **Confidence in Engineering:** Seeing their bridges hold weight gave the kids a sense of accomplishment, boosting their confidence in tackling future STEM-related projects.

6. **Inspiration for the Future:** By introducing basic physics and engineering concepts through fun, hands-on activities, we hope to have sparked a passion for civil engineering and related fields in some of the kids.

## Summary

- Introduced the physics of bridges, focusing on tension and compression
- Built popsicle stick bridges, emphasizing practical learning
- Connected principles to the iconic Golden Gate Bridge
- Fostered teamwork, problem-solving, and an interest in engineering

The kids had a blast building their bridges and learning about the forces that make structures strong. We're excited to see how this experience ignites their curiosity for future STEM challenges!
