At STEMpathy, we were honored to partner with **Boys to Men Mentoring**—a program dedicated to supporting and empowering young men facing challenges—to run a special **bridge-building workshop**. Using popsicle sticks, hot glue, and teamwork, the participants learned engineering concepts while building trust, confidence, and connection.

## What is Boys to Men Mentoring?

Boys to Men Mentoring provides consistent group mentoring to teenage boys, especially those identified as “at‑risk” or in need of positive male role models. ([Boys To Men Mentoring Network][1]) Their curriculum encourages honest sharing, accountability, and self-reflection, rather than lectures or directives. ([Boys To Men Mentoring Network][2]) In this workshop, we sought to mesh hands-on STEM learning with the mentoring values of support, growth, and resilience.

## What did we do?

We began by introducing the students to the physics behind bridges—how forces like **compression** and **tension** act on structural elements, and why certain designs are stronger than others. We referenced real-world bridges, such as the Golden Gate Bridge, to anchor their learning in the real world.

Then, in small groups, the boys built their own **popsicle stick and hot-glue bridges**. They designed and iterated, discussing how to distribute load and reinforce weak spots. At the end of the session, each bridge was tested by placing weights (books or other items) on top until it failed. This dramatic test brought the learning to life.

## Impacts & Reflections

Working on bridges offered more than a physics lesson—it created space for growth, mentoring, and connection:

1. **Hands-On Learning Builds Confidence**
   Many participants were unfamiliar with engineering or STEM concepts. Building something they could see, touch, and test gave them a tangible sense of accomplishment.

2. **Real Consequences & Resilience**
   When bridges collapsed under weight, it wasn’t just a “failure”—it became an opportunity. We encouraged them to analyze why, rebuild, and try again. This mirrors real-life growth.

3. **Teamwork with Shared Goals**
   In small groups, participants practiced communication, compromise, and mutual support. They shared ideas, divided roles, and helped fix each other’s bridges.

4. **Mentoring in Action**
   As mentors and facilitators, we didn’t “teach” in the traditional sense—but listened, asked guiding questions, and shared stories of our own challenges. This aligns with Boys to Men’s approach of honest sharing and letting the mentees make choices. ([Boys To Men Mentoring Network][2])

5. **Empowering Ownership**
   The participants felt a sense of ownership over their designs and their learning. They saw that with thoughtful planning and perseverance, they could shape outcomes.

6. **Building Connection & Trust**
   Working side by side on a project created rapport, vulnerability, and shared experience. The hands-on task gave everyone a common ground to engage.

## Summary

* Introduced bridge physics (compression, tension, load distribution)
* Built popsicle stick & hot-glue bridges in mentoring groups
* Tested each design by applying weight
* Encouraged iteration, analysis, and resilience
* Integrated mentoring values—listening, sharing, empowering
* Fostered teamwork, confidence, and deeper relationships
