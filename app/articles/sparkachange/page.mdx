STEMpathy partnered with the **Spark-A-Change Foundation** in India to host a dynamic **robotics workshop** that brought STEM learning to life. Using **LEGO SPIKE Prime kits**, students built and programmed their own robots while gaining hands-on experience with coding, engineering, and problem-solving.

## What did we do?

We began by introducing the students to the fundamentals of robotics—how machines can be built to sense, think, and move. Using LEGO SPIKE Prime, they learned block-based programming to control motors, sensors, and robot behavior.

Once familiar with the basics, students dove into building their own robots. Whether it was designing a bot that could follow a line, avoid obstacles, or move on command, each group brought creativity and determination to their builds. We also introduced basic challenges to encourage collaboration and experimentation.

## Impacts

This workshop gave students the chance to explore technology in a hands-on, empowering way. Here’s how it made an impact:

1. **Accessible Robotics Education:** For many students, this was their first time interacting with robotics—and they quickly discovered how fun and approachable it could be.

2. **Foundations in Coding:** Learning block-based programming helped demystify how robots work and introduced core logic and problem-solving skills.

3. **Hands-On Learning:** Building real robots allowed students to connect theoretical concepts to real-world actions.

4. **Creative Engineering:** Students had the freedom to design and personalize their robots, encouraging innovation and outside-the-box thinking.

5. **Collaboration and Teamwork:** Working in pairs or small teams, students practiced communication, shared ideas, and supported one another through challenges.

6. **STEM Confidence:** Seeing their robots successfully move, turn, or react based on their code gave students a strong sense of accomplishment and excitement for learning.

## Summary

* Hosted a robotics workshop at Spark-A-Change Foundation using LEGO SPIKE Prime
* Taught block-based coding and robot engineering basics
* Promoted problem-solving, creativity, and collaboration
* Inspired confidence and curiosity in future STEM pathways

The students at Spark-A-Change showed incredible enthusiasm and potential. We're proud to have shared this experience with them and can’t wait to see where their curiosity takes them next!
