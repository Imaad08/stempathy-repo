STEMpathy returned to the 4S Ranch Library for another exciting workshop—this time exploring the **science of flight**! Through hands-on paper airplane activities, students learned about the forces that allow planes to fly and experimented with different designs to maximize flight time.

## What did we do?

In this session, students crafted their own paper airplanes and tested them to find the most effective design. We introduced the **four forces of flight**—**lift**, **thrust**, **drag**, and **gravity**—and explained how each one affects how an airplane flies.

After learning the basics, the kids folded, tested, and modified their airplanes, aiming to increase flight time. Some added flaps, adjusted wing shapes, or changed folds based on how their planes performed in test flights.

## Impacts

This workshop gave students a playful but educational look at physics and aerodynamics. Here’s what they gained:

1. **STEM in Action:** Making and testing paper airplanes brought abstract physics concepts to life in a way that was easy to understand and fun.

2. **Understanding Flight:** By observing how different designs flew, students saw how real airplanes rely on balancing forces like lift and drag.

3. **Design Iteration:** The ability to modify and retest their planes helped students learn the value of trial, error, and optimization.

4. **Critical Thinking:** Kids were encouraged to analyze what worked and why, developing their problem-solving and reasoning skills.

5. **Creativity and Innovation:** No two airplanes were the same—students used their creativity to make designs they thought would perform best.

6. **Excitement for STEM:** The open-ended nature of the activity made learning about physics enjoyable and approachable.

## Summary

* Taught the four forces of flight (lift, thrust, drag, gravity)
* Students built and tested paper airplanes
* Emphasized design, testing, and optimization
* Fostered creativity, experimentation, and interest in physics

This flight-themed workshop combined fun and science to help students explore how things fly—and inspired them to keep asking "what if?" with every fold and throw.
