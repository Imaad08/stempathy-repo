At the 4S Ranch Library, STEMpathy hosted a fun and engaging workshop where kids learned about the principles of aerodynamics and structural engineering through building paper airplanes and popsicle stick bridges.

## What did we do?
We kicked off the session with a quick introduction to the science behind flight and bridge stability. Then, we let the kids dive right into the hands-on activities:

1. **Paper Airplanes:** The kids designed their own paper airplanes and learned how different wing shapes and folds affect flight. We explained concepts like lift, drag, and thrust, showing them how these forces work together to make a plane fly.

2. **Popsicle Stick Bridges:** Next, we shifted to structural engineering by guiding the kids to build their own popsicle stick bridges. We talked about forces like tension and compression, explaining how bridges support weight. The kids used glue to hold their bridges together, testing the strength of their creations afterward.


## Hands-On Learning
The best part of the workshop was seeing the kids bring science to life by experimenting themselves. After showing them a demo, we encouraged them to tweak their paper airplanes and bridge designs to improve their performance. They flew their planes in the library’s open space, testing how well their designs could glide, and then took on the challenge of making bridges that could support more and more weight.

## Impacts

This session was packed with fun and learning. Here’s how it impacted the kids:

1. **Engagement with STEM Concepts:** The kids didn’t just hear about science; they saw it in action. By building their own paper airplanes and bridges, they directly experienced the principles of flight and structural integrity.

2. **Creativity and Exploration:** The hands-on nature of the activities allowed the kids to experiment with different designs, fostering creativity and encouraging them to think like engineers.

3. **Understanding Engineering Basics:** We taught them about the balance of forces in flight and bridge-building. Concepts like lift, drag, tension, and compression became more meaningful when applied to their creations.

4. **Problem-Solving and Iteration:** As their paper airplanes flew (or crashed), the kids adjusted their designs to improve performance. With the bridges, they learned from their first attempts and made stronger structures through trial and error.

5. **Collaboration and Teamwork:** Working together in pairs and groups, the kids helped each other build and test designs. This collaboration not only boosted their engineering skills but also enhanced their ability to communicate and work as a team.

6. **Building Confidence in STEM:** Successfully flying a plane or building a sturdy bridge gave the kids a sense of achievement, motivating them to continue exploring science and engineering.

## Summary

- We taught paper airplane design and bridge-building using popsicle sticks.
- Kids learned about aerodynamics, structural integrity, and forces like lift, drag, and compression.
- They had the chance to build and test their designs, fostering creativity, problem-solving, and teamwork.
- The session inspired curiosity and excitement about STEM topics.

It was a fantastic day of learning, filled with excitement as the kids tested their creations and learned about the science behind them. We can’t wait to see how this sparks their future interest in engineering!
