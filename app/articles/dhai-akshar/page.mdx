STEMpathy had the pleasure of hosting a hands-on **robotics workshop** at the **Dhai Akshar Foundation** in India, bringing the excitement of STEM to life through **LEGO SPIKE Prime kits**. This session introduced students to the basics of robotics, engineering, and programming in a fun and interactive way.

## What did we do?

Using LEGO SPIKE Prime, students learned how to build and program their own robots from scratch. We started with an introduction to robotics and block-based coding, making sure every student understood how to control motors, sensors, and movement. As they gained confidence, they began experimenting with different robot designs and functions.

From obstacle detection to movement challenges, students had the chance to test, troubleshoot, and improve their creations while working in small groups. The energy in the room was electric as robots came to life under their command.

## Impacts

This workshop opened up a world of possibilities for students, many of whom were exploring robotics for the very first time. Here’s how it made a difference:

1. **Introduction to Robotics and Coding:** Students learned core concepts in a beginner-friendly way, laying the foundation for future learning.

2. **Hands-On Experience:** Building physical robots made abstract STEM ideas more real and engaging.

3. **Problem-Solving and Iteration:** Students encountered real engineering challenges and used logic and teamwork to overcome them.

4. **Creativity and Design:** Each team approached their robot builds differently, showcasing unique ideas and innovative solutions.

5. **Teamwork and Communication:** Collaboration was key, helping students practice sharing ideas, assigning roles, and working toward a common goal.

6. **STEM Confidence:** Watching their robots move as a result of their own code gave students a huge confidence boost and a sense of accomplishment.

## Summary

* Introduced LEGO SPIKE Prime robotics at Dhai Akshar Foundation
* Taught block-based coding and robot building
* Encouraged problem-solving, creativity, and hands-on learning
* Sparked confidence, curiosity, and interest in STEM fields

We were truly inspired by the enthusiasm and determination of the students at Dhai Akshar. It was a joy to watch their imaginations come to life through robotics—and we hope this is just the beginning of their journey into the world of STEM.
