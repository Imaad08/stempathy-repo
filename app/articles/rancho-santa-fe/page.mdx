STEMpathy reached out to R. Roger Rowe School in Rancho Santa Fe to teach some of the fifth grade classes about bridges as well as give them a hands on experience.

## What did we do? 
We were given the opportunity to teach two fifth grade classes about briges and physics such as fun facts and the physics behind them.

The fifth graders were really interested in the topic and were eager to learn more about it. They were excited to see the impact of bridges on the environment and how they can help save the environment. After the lesson was done, we gave them a hands on experience by building a bridge. We provided stations that had popsicle sticks and hot glue guns. We showed them how to use the popsicle sticks to build the bridge and then used hot glue to fix the bridge together. The students were able to follow along and build a very strong popsicle stick bridge that they could stand on. They were very excited to see the bridge hold their weight and were amazed at how strong it was. They were very proud of their work and were excited to take it home to show their parents. It was also a great team building exercise as they had to work together to build the bridge. The students were very engaged throughout the lesson and were asking lots of questions. They were very interested in the physics behind bridges and how they work. They were also very interested in the different types of bridges and how they are used in different parts of the world. They were very excited to learn about the forces that act on a bridge and how engineers design bridges to withstand these forces. Overall, it was a very successful lesson and the students had a great time learning about bridges. They were very excited to learn more about the topic and were eager to build more bridges in the future. We hope that this lesson will inspire them to pursue a career in engineering and make a positive impact on the world.

## Impacts

Teaching fifth graders about bridges and physics through hands-on activities like building their own bridge can have significant impacts on their learning and development. Here are some potential impacts on the kids:

1. **Engagement and Interest:** The hands-on experience of building a bridge using popsicle sticks and hot glue guns likely captured the attention and interest of the students. Engaging in practical activities can make learning more enjoyable and memorable for young learners.

2. **Understanding of Concepts:** By actively participating in building a bridge, students would have gained a deeper understanding of the physics principles behind bridges, such as forces, structure, and stability. This practical application of theoretical knowledge can enhance comprehension and retention.

3. **Problem-Solving Skills:** Building a bridge requires problem-solving skills as students encounter challenges and obstacles along the way. They would have learned how to overcome these challenges through trial and error, fostering resilience and critical thinking skills.

4. **Teamwork and Collaboration:** Collaborating with their classmates to construct the bridge would have promoted teamwork and cooperation. Students would have learned how to communicate effectively, delegate tasks, and work together towards a common goal.

5. **Sense of Achievement:** Successfully building a bridge that can hold their weight would have instilled a sense of achievement and pride in the students. This positive reinforcement can boost their confidence and motivation to tackle future challenges.

6. **Real-World Relevance:** Learning about bridges and their impact on the environment can help students make connections between classroom learning and real-world applications. Understanding how bridges contribute to environmental conservation can inspire them to think critically about sustainability issues.

7. **Inspiration for Future Careers:** Exposing students to STEM topics like engineering at a young age can spark an interest in pursuing related careers in the future. By experiencing the excitement of building a bridge firsthand, some students may be inspired to explore further studies and careers in engineering or related fields.

Overall, initiatives like the one undertaken by STEMpathy at R. Roger Rowe School can have profound impacts on students, not only in terms of academic learning but also in fostering essential skills and igniting a passion for STEM subjects.
