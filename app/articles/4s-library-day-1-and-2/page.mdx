STEMpathy had the wonderful opportunity to teach robotics and programming to a group of kids at the 4S Ranch Library. Using LEGO SPIKE PRIME kits, we introduced the basics of robotics, along with block-based and Python programming.

## What did we do?
We led a hands-on workshop where the kids learned how to build and program their own robots. Through block coding, they got a visual understanding of programming concepts, and for more advanced learners, we introduced Python to give them a deeper dive into text-based coding.

The kids were excited to bring their robots to life, especially when their creations could move, turn, and react to obstacles. We made sure to keep the session interactive by encouraging them to experiment with their programs, tweak their robots, and collaborate with each other.

## Impacts

Teaching robotics and programming to young learners can have a lasting impact. Here's how this workshop benefited the kids:

1. **Hands-on Engagement:** Working with LEGO SPIKE PRIME allowed the kids to directly apply what they learned, making the experience fun and memorable. They loved watching their robots execute the commands they programmed.

2. **Introduction to Programming:** For many kids, this was their first experience with block coding or Python. The workshop sparked their interest in programming and showed how coding can control real-world objects like robots.

3. **Problem-Solving:** Robotics presented challenges that the kids needed to solve on the spot, whether it was troubleshooting coding errors or adjusting their robots' mechanics. This built resilience and critical thinking.

4. **Collaboration and Teamwork:** The kids worked in pairs or small groups, which encouraged collaboration. They helped each other debug programs, exchange ideas, and share success.

5. **Confidence in STEM:** Seeing their robots move as a result of their coding boosted the kids' confidence in their abilities. They were eager to learn more and even try more complex tasks by the end of the session.

6. **Inspiration for the Future:** Introducing STEM concepts through hands-on learning may have ignited a passion for technology and engineering, motivating some to pursue future careers in these fields.

## Summary

- Introduced LEGO SPIKE PRIME robotics
- Taught block coding and Python to kids
- Encouraged hands-on building and programming
- Fostered teamwork, problem-solving, and a love for STEM

Overall, the kids had a blast building robots and learning to code. We're excited to see how this sparks their curiosity for future STEM adventures!
