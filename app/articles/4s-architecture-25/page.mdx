STEMpathy wrapped up another exciting week at the 4S Ranch Library—this time focusing on **architecture and structural design**! Using marshmallows and thick toothpicks, students became mini architects, building strong and creative structures while learning about balance, shapes, and stability.

## What did we do?

In this hands-on workshop, students were challenged to build the tallest or strongest structure they could using only marshmallows and toothpicks. We introduced them to key architectural concepts like **triangulation**, **weight distribution**, and **structural integrity**, explaining why some shapes (like triangles) are stronger than others (like squares).

Students experimented with different shapes and base designs, learning how to improve stability and height through smart construction techniques. Some teams even tried to replicate famous structures or invented their own designs.

## Impacts

This session gave students a fun and tactile way to explore the fundamentals of architecture and engineering. Here's what they took away:

1. **Hands-On Engineering:** Building with simple materials helped kids understand how real-world structures are designed for strength and balance.

2. **Understanding Structural Concepts:** Concepts like load-bearing shapes and base width were easy to grasp when applied directly to their own builds.

3. **Trial and Error:** Many structures collapsed at first, but students learned to test, revise, and rebuild—mirroring the real engineering process.

4. **Creative Problem-Solving:** With limited materials, students had to think outside the box to improve stability and height.

5. **Collaboration and Communication:** Working in pairs or small groups encouraged idea-sharing and cooperative design.

6. **Confidence in STEM:** Seeing their towers grow taller and stronger gave students a sense of achievement and sparked curiosity about real-world architecture.

## Summary

* Taught basics of architectural design and structural strength
* Built marshmallow-toothpick towers using real engineering principles
* Explored shapes, balance, and load distribution
* Promoted creativity, teamwork, and resilience through building challenges

This final workshop was the perfect way to close out our STEM series—combining fun, design, and discovery to inspire the next generation of engineers and architects!
